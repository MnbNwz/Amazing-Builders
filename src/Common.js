  aboutUsText2:
    "In an industry being filled with companies that simply reproduce more and more variants of the same house – as if each fell from a giant cookie-cutter. Few bother to challenge the status quo or alter the norm. Building a home should be an exciting and personal journey and the finished product a symbol of pride. This is why Matrix specialise in custom homes guiding clients through this personal journey.",
