    "Founded by two partners who had different skills and experiences but a shared vision and entrepreneurial spirit, Matrix Designer Builders is a rising Australian home builder with a wide array of experience in residential housing.",
  aboutUsText2:
    "In an industry being filled with companies that simply reproduce more and more variants of the same house – as if each fell from a giant cookie-cutter. Few bother to challenge the status quo or alter the norm. Building a home should be an exciting and personal journey and the finished product a symbol of pride. This is why Matrix specialise in custom homes guiding clients through this personal journey.",

    "In partnership with our valued trades and suppliers, we pride ourselves on delivering quality homes in communities where our customers want to live.",
